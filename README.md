# Azure Cognitive Service | Computer Vision API 
Optical character recognition, using Python with help of Azure Cognitive Service | Computer Vision API

I used Digital Ocean to create a virtual server to host my code.
Postman will be needed to use the code for read as I did not create an application for a front end.

Please configure Postman with your content-type as application/json.
Choose POST from the drop down
your post will go to http://134.209.113.53:5000 which is my Digital Ocean virtual server.  It is listening on port 5000.
This will be a read request so please add /read to the end of your post.
Please make sure "Body" is selected in the menu
Please make sure "raw" is selected in the menu

Put the URL you would like to analyze into the request.
